"""Shared constants for Programmatic Tool Calling (PTC).

PTC lets the model write Python/Bash code that calls LibreChat tools as
async functions. Because KubeCodeRun execution pods have **no network
egress** (NetworkPolicy ``egress: []``), the live-callback bridge used by
hosted code interpreters is impossible here. Instead PTC uses the
**stateless replay model**: each round the sandbox re-runs the user code
from scratch, replaying prior tool results from an injected history file
(``_ptc_history.json``); on the first un-cached tool call it prints a
scoped sentinel block and exits, and the API relays that call to LibreChat
which executes it and continues the loop.

This mirrors the reference ``code-interpreter`` service so the
``@librechat/agents`` ``ProgrammaticToolCalling`` client (which POSTs to
``/exec/programmatic``) works unchanged.
